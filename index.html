                <p>
                    "Blockchain technology has the potential to boost global gross domestic product (GDP) by US$1.76
                    trillion over the next decade." (PWC, 2020). Nevertheless, what is blockchain technology? Blockchain
                    is
                    a decentralized, unchangeable database that makes tracking assets and recording transactions in a
                    corporate network easier. Within a blockchain network, recording and trading nearly any valuable
                    item
                    becomes possible, which enhances efficiency and reduces risks for all involved parties (IBM, n.d.).
                    Blockchain technology includes many features. One of its key features is decentralization. In the
                    blockchain, decentralization refers to transferring control and decision-making from a centralized
                    entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network (AWS, n.d.). Applying
                    blockchain technology in any industry could improve traceability. When a transaction involving the
                    swapping of goods is documented on a blockchain ledger, a traceable record is accessible to reveal
                    the
                    origins of the items involved. This can not only assist exchange-related organizations in increasing
                    security and avoiding fraud, but it can also help confirm the legitimacy of the exchanged assets. It
                    may
                    be used to follow the supply chain from producer to distributor in sectors like pharmaceuticals, or
                    it
                    can be used to establish ownership in sectors like the arts. Secondly, blockchain eliminates the
                    need
                    for intermediaries in many procedures for industries like payments and real estate because of its
                    decentralized nature. Blockchain enables quicker transactions by enabling P2P cross-border transfers
                    with a digital currency compared to traditional financial services. A uniform system of ownership
                    records and smart contracts that automate tenant-landlord agreements improve the efficiency of
                    property
                    management procedures (Koskal, 2019). Blockchain technology, as a decentralized and unchangeable
                    database, holds the potential to revolutionize various industries by enhancing traceability and
                    improving efficiency. Blockchain should be used more widely in society because by incorporating
                    blockchain technology into various industries and aspects of society, we can benefit from increased
                    security, transparency, efficiency, and traceability, ultimately driving innovation and economic
                    growth.
                    However, blockchain may face scalability, energy consumption, complexity, and regulatory
                    uncertainties
                    that must be addressed for widespread adoption.
                </p>

                    Firstly, the economy will gain from the increasing use of blockchain technology. Between 2022 and
                    2030, the blockchain technology market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate
                    (CAGR) of 85.9% (2021), expanding from a market valuation of USD 5.92 billion in 2021 and
                    potentially contributing to a global GDP increase of up to US$1.76 trillion by 2030. Legalizing
                    cryptocurrencies in nations like El Salvador and Ukraine is anticipated to open up new opportunities
                    for market growth (Grandviewresearch.com, n.d.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the opinion of its proponents, blockchain technology, notably in the financial industry, can
                    drastically increase the productivity and profitability of most firms, if not all of them—or perhaps
                    transform the way we do business entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of blockchain technology allows users worldwide to use financial services that they
                    previously could not. People in emerging nations such as India, Nigeria, Kenya, and the Philippines
                    are examples of emerging nations where blockchain technology could provide access to financial
                    services for unbanked or underbanked populations, where it is more challenging to use regular banks,
                    may utilize blockchain technology to get these services (PWC, 2020). China ($440 billion) and the
                    USA ($407 billion) are the two countries with the most significant potential net benefits from
                    blockchain. </p>
                <p>
                    Many developing countries lack the robust banking, internet, or electronic systems required to take
                    advantage of the global digital transformation, but adopting blockchain technology and
                    cryptocurrencies could be crucial to assisting these countries "leapfrog" — a process that involves
                    utilizing new technologies to skip over traditional stages of infrastructure development and close
                    gaps — and help these countries benefit from the global digital transformation (Getsmarter.com,
                    2022). To provide micro-loans to vendors in Kenya, IBM collaborated with Twiga Foods, an African
                    business-to-business logistics network for kiosks and food stalls. These loans were designed to
                    assist merchants in acquiring and controlling additional inventory. IBM's contribution was building
                    a blockchain-enabled loan infrastructure that could assess the creditworthiness of food providers.
                    Blockchain technology has been utilized to track toxin levels in Nigeria, where efforts are being
                    made to clean up the river belt. These statistics are necessary for the reporting requirements of
                    the international organizations supporting these initiatives (Reiff, 2021). By enabling nations to
                    overcome technological and infrastructural barriers, promoting financial inclusion, and simplifying
                    their integration into the global digital economy, the use of blockchain technology in developing
                    nations can significantly increase economic growth.

                    However, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies may occasionally still be erratic. A nation that
                    only uses cryptocurrencies may experience volatility. Although stable currencies are employed, the
                    stable currency of the "terra" crypto ecosystem failed. Blockchain technology is already having an
                    evident impact on the world economy and financial policies. However, some of the consequences are
                    harder to see. Worker replacement by efficient blockchain-based apps may increase unemployment rates
                    in various industries. Of course, as cryptocurrency becomes more popular, the market's volatility is
                    increasingly influencing global financial markets (Kriptomat.io, n.d.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The U.S. Treasury Department cautioned that unregulated digital currencies might threaten the U.S.
                    financial system. This warning was included in the inaugural comprehensive public report on digital
                    assets published by the Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council pinpointed
                    crypto assets like stablecoins and the practice of lending and borrowing on the sector's trading
                    platforms as a "significant emerging vulnerability." "important emerging vulnerability." According
                    to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in 2021, the report states that crypto-asset activities may
                    present risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system. It highlights the significance of
                    relevant regulation, including enforcing current laws. Yellen emphasized the necessity for
                    government stakeholders to collaborate to advance the recommendations laid out in the report,
                    referring to the situation as an "important emerging vulnerability" (U.S. Department of the
                    Treasury, 2021). At the beginning of this year, the Treasury Department imposed a range of sanctions
                    on Russian oligarchs, specific Russian banks, and other organizations, citing their use of crypto
                    assets to circumvent sanctions. In September, the department froze all assets held or controlled by
                    U.S. individuals, about 22 individuals, and two organizations that facilitated the digital funding
                    of Russia's invasion of Ukraine (Cox, 2022). This measure demonstrates the government's commitment
                    to combating illicit financial activities and ensuring that digital currency networks are not
                    exploited maliciously.

                <p>
                    Although blockchain can benefit economies, it can also significantly impact the environment. The New
                    York Times (2022) claims that the yearly electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is close to
                    91 terawatt-hours (91 TWh), which is more than that of nations like Finland. According to some
                    reports, this amount is 150 TWh annually, equivalent to more energy than Argentina, a country with
                    45 million inhabitants (Clarke, 2022). Annualized power consumption from worldwide crypto-assets
                    increased quickly between 2018 and 2022, according to projections. Published projections of the
                    total yearly power consumption for crypto-assets as of August 2022 range from 120 to 240 billion
                    kilowatt-hours, exceeding the total annual electricity consumption of several individual nations,
                    such as Argentina or Australia. This is comparable to the yearly power use of all traditional data
                    centers worldwide, representing 0.4% to 0.9% of the world's total annual electricity consumption
                    (Whitehouse.gov, 2022). Because we use fossil-fired electricity, the highest market capitalization
                    cryptocurrency assets generate 140-30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide yearly (Mt CO2/y),
                    roughly 0.3% of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions. According to estimates, the U.S.
                    cryptocurrency market generates 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, or 0.4% to 0.8% of the country's greenhouse gas
                    emissions (Whitehouse.gov, 2022).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) is consensus algorithms used in blockchain networks to
                    validate and secure transactions. PoW relies on miners solving complex mathematical puzzles to
                    validate transactions and create new blocks. This process requires significant computational power,
                    which also consumes substantial energy (Nakamoto, 2008). PoS, on the other hand, selects validators
                    based on their stake (amount of cryptocurrency held) and other factors, such as the duration of
                    holding. PoS network evaluators propose new blocks and validate transactions without
                    energy-intensive computations, making it a more eco-friendly alternative (Buterin, 2021).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The energy consumption of crypto assets is primarily driven by consensus mechanisms, such as
                    distributed ledger technology, which is required for mining and validating transactions. The
                    blockchains of Bitcoin and Ethereum both employ Proof of Work (PoW), the most popular consensus
                    algorithm. More than 60% of the market value of all crypto assets is made up of Bitcoin and Ether
                    combined. This feature prevents hostile actors from assaulting the network by making the PoW method
                    more computationally intensive as more entities seek to validate transactions for coin rewards.
                    Ethereum is projected to account for 20% to 39% of all global crypto-asset electricity usage by
                    August 2022, while Bitcoin is expected to account for 60% to 77%. In addition to using grid
                    electricity that has been purchased, crypto-asset mining operations may also have an impact on
                    nearby noise and water quality, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct use of
                    fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts from all grid electricity
                    usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for nearby communities, which
                    are frequently already burdened by other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. When not directly
                    utilizing renewable power, the development of energy-intensive crypto-asset technology might make it
                    more difficult for the United States to meet its NDC under the Paris Agreement and prevent the worst
                    effects of climate change. The federal government must take steps to promote and guarantee
                    responsible development as crypto asset acceptance increases and new forms of digital assets may be
                    introduced. This entails avoiding detrimental effects on neighborhood populations, dramatically
                    lowering energy intensity, and using clean electricity as a source of energy (Whitehouse.gov, 2022).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, according to (Clarke, 2022), there may not be a firm consensus on how mining
                    cryptocurrencies on PoW networks impacts the environment. There has been a push to adopt blockchain
                    to save energy and improve the environment. As a result, the utilization of renewable energy sources
                    for Bitcoin mining has increased by over 60% this year. Another use of blockchain is to lower
                    atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide. Blockchain technology, when
                    applied to carbon credits, has the potential to benefit the environment significantly. R. A. Wilson,
                    Chief Technical Officer of 1GCX, a global exchange for digital assets and carbon credits, argues
                    that labeling Bitcoin as "bad" for the environment oversimplifies the issue and neglects important
                    nuances and conversations. While it is true that proof-of-work networks, such as Bitcoin and others,
                    consume more energy than proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, it is essential to consider other
                    factors when evaluating the environmental impact of Bitcoin and blockchain technology as a whole
                    (Clarke, 2022). Those who acknowledge these complexities may need to include the bigger picture and
                    the potential for blockchain to contribute positively to environmental solutions.

                    In summary, blockchain technology has enormous potential to transform several industries and
                    increase global GDP by US$1.76 trillion over the following ten years. Its decentralized and
                    immutable nature improves efficiency and traceability, generating tremendous value for the global
                    economy. Blockchain technology can increase financial inclusion in underdeveloped nations and help
                    the environment through cutting-edge uses like carbon credits. By increasing productivity, lowering
                    transaction costs, and promoting transparency across various industries, blockchain technology can
                    increase GDP by promoting economic growth and innovation. However, challenges remain to be resolved,
                    such as the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the negative impacts of energy-intensive consensus
                    methods like Proof of Work on the environment. In order to explore different consensus mechanisms,
                    such as Proof of Stake, which offers a more environmentally friendly solution, and to establish
                    appropriate regulations to ensure the technology is not misused for bad intentions, more research is
                    required as nations and businesses continue to adopt blockchain. It is critical to weigh the
                    advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technology as we look back on its development and to
                    support further research and development. By doing this, we can use the potential of blockchain to
                    transform industries, improve people's lives, and help create a more equal and sustainable future.
